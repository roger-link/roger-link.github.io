								<div class="post-summary">I’ve spent the past few years working on a kid-friendly variety show called Whoop Dee Doo. It’s been a life-changing experience that has taught me a great deal about collaboration, diy, non-profit management, and many, many more things. Here are some photos I have taken from this experience.</div>

								<div class="post-summary">I had the opportunity to work on an installation for the Time Based Art Festival hosted by the Portland based PICA organization. The project was part of a larger effort by Whoop Dee Doo to create an environment themed around ‘the body’. I worked with two other people to create an all encompassing room themed after the brain. The room contained a large brain that visitors could manipulate to control “memories” projected onto the wall. To the visitor it appeared as if they were controlling the brains thoughts. I used an arduino, tilt switches, MAX MSP, and found video footage to create the brain. The room was created from discarded materials including carpet, trash bags, metallic bowls, and lot’s of hot glue. Natalie Myers and Chris Beer helped with the design.</div>
